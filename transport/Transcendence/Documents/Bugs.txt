Pri	Date		Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1  08-11-2002	Need to disable StickyKeys while playing (otherwise, rapidly
				pressing the shift key will activate StickyKeys (although perhaps
				not in DX exclusive mode).
 1	09-08-2002	Insurance claim will probably not work if the player dies in the
				battle arena or during Korolov missions.
 2  06-30-2002	Crash if we try to close the app while loading (race condition
				with loading thread).
 2	09-02-2000	Areas inside of frames do not get a MouseLeave message when the
				mouse leaves the frame. [DirectXUtil]
 2  07-13-2002	When destroyed by a named station we shouldn't use the indefinite
				article (e.g., "destroyed by a Hellas Station")
 2	06-26-2004	Somehow I ended up with 2 installed front segments. I had an enhanced
				segment of reactive armor. When I tried to install a segment of
				plasteel, the reactive armor stayed installed.
 3  03-23-2002	Sometimes (rarely) stations end up on top of planets. When that
				happens it is impossible to hit them.
 3  04-27-2002	Line drawing does not honor DirectXUtil image clip rects
 3	09-21-2002	If a station has multiple weapons of the same type and the station
				is destroyed and 2 or more of the weapons survive, then they don't
				appear as one CItem. The problem is that many of the SetXXXAtCursor
				functions don't fold items together.

Pri	Date		Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2	09-02-2000	LRS should use scaling algorithm that preserves relative relationship
				of objects (see Map view).
 2	09-02-2000	Esc should work in map view.
 2  10-21-2000	Armor and devices looted from a wreck do not combine with existing
				items of the same type.
 3  09-11-2000	Enemy ship laser beam don't seem to be straight. It looks like the
				algorithm I use to make laser beams straight for the POV will distort
				the beam for other objects. Should use two different algorithms.
 2	03-03-2001	Sometimes it seems that tenhove sentinels protecting a station
				get lost and start wandering away.
				Solution: The problem was that heuristic for calculating the
				interception point was buggy. It would not properly take into account
				the closing speed of the ship and would sometimes compute an interception
				point behind the sentinel.
 2	04-15-2001	High-score list clips
 3	01-12-2001	When player has mining laser, beam doesn't seem to be straight.
				[Fix: This was tricky to fix. We need to adjust the starting position
				of the beam in order to make it look like it is coming out of the
				ship that fired it (to compensate for the moving ship). Unfortunately,
				the compensation calculation depended on the update order of the
				objects in the system.]
 2  04-15-2001	While in the middle of docking, 'D' should not try to dock with
				a different station (it should either do nothing or cancel the dock).
				[Fix: Does nothing now.]
 2	04-15-2001	Tenhove sentinel bitmap needs to be fixed.
 1  06-19-2002	Crash when restarting the game a gating to a system. The problem was
				that I wasn't clearing out the m_pSystem variable in the CTopologyNode
				structure between games.
 1  07-27-2002	Crash CStandardShipAI.cpp(200). m_pTarget is NULL, but m_Goal
				is goalDestroyTarget. This may have happened because of a load/save
				problem. I added code in load game to ASSERT if we ever fail to
				resolve all references.
				[Fix: I believe that the problem was that when an enemy ship is
				attacked, the CStandardShipAI code will attempt to set the goal
				of attacking the attacker. However, in some cases, the "attacker"
				is only the beam or missile hitting the ship. In that case, we
				try to destroy the beam or missile and never hear about its
				destruction. If we then go to save this state, we will try to save
				a pointer to a bogus objects. On load, we will leave the pointer
				NULL.]
 1	11-30-2001	Crash CStandardShipAI.cpp(87). Note: On 12-15-2001 I fixed a bug
				in CSpaceObject::GetNearestEnemies that may explain this crash.
				[Fix: Haven't seen this crash since then. 07-27-2002]
 2	05-12-2001	Install SmartCannon with 0 rounds. Now dock with station and
				loot or buy some rounds. Target display does not update.
 2	10-28-2001	Ships with more than one missile type do not select the next missile
				properly. [This should be fixed by new code to select missiles. 10-10-2002]
 1	02-09-2003	Crashed because we were unable to resolve object references on load.
				[Fix: I believe the problem is that in CStandardShipAI.cpp(1126) we
				try to NULL the pointers to targets that have been destroyed. Unfortunately,
				the loop started at 1 instead of 0 because it assumed that the first entry
				had already been fixed up. Instead, the first entry had been deleted, so
				the second entry (now first) never got fixed-up.]
 1	03-16-2003	Crashed again because we were unable to resolve object references.
				[Fix: I believe I didn't fix a previous bug (07-27-2002) correctly. There
				were still parts of the code that would target a beam or a missile. In particular,
				in the OnObjectDestroyed function I added a check of CanAttack before targeting
				pDestroyer.]
 1	04-27-2003	Fixed a bug in which a random encounter was sent out to attack the CPOVMarker
				object. This could happen if the player was destroyed (or gated out) just as an
				encounter happened. Since the CPOVMarker object does not notify others when it
				is destroyed (because it is a fake object) this could result in garbage in the
				Orders table. I fixed this by not allowing CPOVMarker objects (any object that
				can't attack) be the target of a random encounter.
 1	06-29-2004	If we exit the game while docked, we don't restore the game properly. Fixed this
				by always Undocking when we exit. Thanks to Brian Lane.
 2	04-18-2001	Targeting computer should be cleared when we gate to a
				different star system. [Tried on 7-24-2004 and it worked fine.]
 1	05-20-2003	Release build does not work on VPR Matrix because DirectX gets
				hosed at start-up. This is probably related to exclusive mode and
				to the fact that the game does not recover if it is ever minimized. [Works now, though
				I don't know why. In any case, filed a different bug about minimized]
 2  09-11-2004	Got into a state in which a friendly station was firing on a wreck (or
				possibly some invisible object). When I saved and restored, the station
				stopped firing. Also, this was after a resurrection (died and continued)
				but not immediately after. [Fix: Turns out that stations were not clearing the
				m_pTarget variable after the target was destroyed or after the target went
				out of range.]
 3	12-08-2004	Fixed a bug in which text was not wrapping correctly when high-ASCII characters
				were present (e.g., em-dash).
 1  09-11-2004  DirectX screws-up when minimizing game. [Fixed in 0.8a]
