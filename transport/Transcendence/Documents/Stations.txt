image:				A tinker gathering is a single station composed of several
					smaller and somewhat independent modules. The station looks like
					a thrown together mess and has antennae and dishes sticking out
					everywhere.

notes:				DOCKING

					A Tinker gathering provides the following services:

					Buy Scrap
					
						Lets the user buy any of the items that the station
						has. The markup is 10%.

					Sell Scrap

						Lets the user sell any damaged item. The mark-down is
						0% because the Tinkers want as much scrap as possible.

					Repair Device

						Point to a device and the Tinker will repair it
						for 30% of its cost when new.

					Repair Armor
					
						Repairs armor as normal except at tech level 7 and with
						the ability to repair armor no matter how damaged.

					Custom Work

						Tinkers can create custom devices using old scrap
						and spare parts (plus a fee of 50 credits). The player
						is given three choices of what to create: a weapon, a
						shield generator, a segment of armor. Then the player is
						asked for an item to use to create the device. Use the
						following table to figure out what is created:

						Armor

						1. heavy titanium armor		<- titanium ore (2 tons)
						2. XMH armor				<- water ice (4 barrels)
						3. photorepair armor		<- armor repair paste (4 barrels)
						3. carbon fiber shell		<- carbon spool (2)
													<- carbon weaver nanos (2 barrels)
						4. plasteel plate			<- plasteel blanks (6)
						5. Tevlar composite armor	<- hyperfiber roll (4)
						6. Duralloy armor			<- Duralloy ore (4 tons)

						Shields

						3. Solon shield generator	<- [damaged] class-II deflectors (2)
													<- [damaged] class-I deflectors (4)
						5. Tinker Deflector Shields <- Enhance shields ROM (4)

						Weapons

						3. dual recoilless			<- [damaged] recoilless cannon (4)
						5. dual turbolaser			<- [damaged] turbolaser cannon (4)
						5. Tinker cannon			<- KM100 Missiles (12)

						Shield	R	5. Tinker Deflector Shields
						hp:40 regen:15/30 dd:30*30
