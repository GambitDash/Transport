IDEAS FOR TRANSCENDENCE
-----------------------

ALIEN PETS

[ ] It would be cool to have an alien or mechanical ship that follows the player
	around much as a pet did in Nethack. It could fight for the player, but it
	would also needs fuel (or better yet, some food stuff that it eats).
[ ] If the pet runs low on food, it can start attacking the player.

ARMOR IDEAS

[ ] Armor that shoots out damage when hit
[ ] Optical displacement armor

ARTIFACTS

[ ] Aura of Domina: Immune to all damage except dark energy/matter damage;
	cannot use certain weapons

AUTONS

[ ] Mine: Explodes as fragmentation missile when enemy approaches; doesn't move.
[ ] Tracker: Like KM500 Stiletto; attacks nearest target.
[ ] Defective Auton: Attacks player with blaster
[ ] Laser Auton: Protects player with blaster
[ ] Cannon Auton: Protects player with Partisan cannon
[ ] Beam Auton: Protects player with particle beam
[ ] Ion Auton: Protects player with ion cannon

BLACK MARKET

[ ] Ability to sell illegal items at Commonwealth station
[ ] Black market needs to have stuff that player needs

COMMONWEALTH

[ ] Station that sells drugs if player has black market ID.

COMMONWEALTH HOSPITAL

This is a commonwealth station that provides high-tech care for wealthy
patients. The hospital has the following wings:

[ ] Reception: The hospital buys medical supplies, etc. at a good
	price.
[ ] Emergency Room: Once in a while the player will be asked to transport
	human organs to another station in the system. If the player can get the
	organs to the station in time, he will be paid 500 credits. If the player
	doesn't deliver the organs, he is blacklisted by the hospital.
[ ] Recovery: This wing is filled with various patients in various stages
	of recovery.
[ ] Hospice: This wing is filled with terminal patients, generally very
	old and wealthy. If the player has a black market ID, the attending
	physician will purchase death drugs.
[ ] Sarcophagi: This wing contains the virtual imprints of various
	body-dead patients. The player can talk to a random patient and
	maybe get some information.
[ ] If the hospital is destroyed and looted the player will find:
	medical supplies, biofactor paste, and possibly, human death cubes.
	(Note: destroying a hospital has the same penalty as destroying
	any other Commonwealth station).

COMMONWEALTH PIRATES

Commonwealth, corporate, and independent stations are plagued by unorganized
pirates in addition to the various larger pirate and outlaw groups. (These should
replace the use of Ronin-class ships, which should always be friendly.)

[ ] Level I: Imp-class gunship
[ ] Level II: pirate freighter (fast, but not very maneuverable and lightly armed)
[ ] Level III: Raptor-class gunship
[ ] Level IV: Raptor II-class gunship
[ ] Level V: Manticore-class missileship
[ ] Level VI: Werewolf-class heavy gunship
[ ] Level VII: Werewolf/advanced-class heavy gunship

DEVICE IDEAS

HELIOTROPES

Heliotropes are nomads that orbit close to a bright star and collect helium3
and other fusion isotopes for conversion into fuel. Although human, they are
a closed society that allows few outsiders and often attacks anyone getting too close.

[ ] Heliotrope Gunship: These small ships protect the main Heliotrope processor.
[ ] Heliotrope Processor: This is a large ship that collects solar particles and
	generates fuel rods.
[ ] Heliotrope Swarm: This is a group of Heliotrope gunships orbiting around
	a Processor.
[ ] Heliotrope Colony: This is a station, often orbiting a planet close to the
	main star. Heliotrope fuel rods have five times the capacity of a normal
	fuel rod (at the same weight).

HINTS AND RUMORS

The game needs more features that entice the player into exploring the system:

[ ]	Rumors: At stations there should be some rumors of stuff in the system.
[ ]	Breadcrumbs: Indicators that lead places (perhaps only between commonwealth
	stations?)
[ ]	Partial maps: Perhaps the player can find partial maps of the system.
[ ]	Regular traffic between friendly stations. Some key stations (commonwealth
	station, colony, etc.) should send out transports to other friendly (not
	independent) stations in the system. They should try to send a few first, and
	only if they survive should they send out regular traffic.
[ ]	Perimeter markers: Major stations should have patrolled and marked perimeters.
	(Especially in ungoverened areas).
[ ] Advertisements: Independent merchants (arms and armor dealers) should advertise
	at gates and near commonwealth stations (have some kind of bitmap image that
	incorporates the name of the station).
[ ] Warnings: Commonwealth stations should place warnings depending on what else
	is in the system. For example, signs warning against pirates.
[ ]	Minefields: Larger enemy stations might have minefields at the perimeter.
[ ]	Maybe commonwealth stations can have markers pointing to other commonwealth
	stations in the system.
[ ]	Corporate enclaves may have a live news ticker that shows stuff going on
	(possibly news of other stations?)
[ ] Rumors about the kinds of items that Tinkers can create
[ ] Crazy idea: The player should be able to talk to CDM entities (or maybe 
	digital ghosts?) to get some hints and rumors. In exchange, the entities ask
	the player to enter some free-form text. Later, fragments of the text can
	appear in other parts of the game (as graffitti, maybe?). Also, perhaps there
	are certain keywords that trigger certain events.

ITEM IDEAS

[ ]	We need to have more items that can only be obtained from wrecks. This should
	give players an incentive to attack and destroy those enemies.
[ ]	Enhance a worthless item to get something good.
[ ] More stuff that the tinkers can convert.
[ ] Stuff that is valuable to a research lab.
[ ]	Stuff that is valuable to Sisters of Domina.
[ ] Exotic stuff from space monsters?
[ ] Convert rare gems and crystals to powerful lasers, etc.
[ ] Allow applying armor paste to uninstalled (as well as installed)
	armor.
[ ] Some types of armor should gain special benefit from paste.
	(e.g., nano-repair on XMH should yield something equivalent
	to Duralloy).
[ ] Anarchist manifesto ROM (probably worthless).
[ ] Heavy items that are either valuable or worthless (as in Nethack gems).

MISCELLANEOUS

[ ] Shield auton: Project a shield around player if close enough.
[ ] All friendly stations should have re-inforcements
[ ] Utopian ships should use blinding cannnons
[ ] Utopians are heliotropes (everything is solar powered)
[x] Rarely, black market IDs at outlaws
[ ] Rescue crime boss at sealed cargo container (to get black market ID?).
[ ] Hardened sensor rig is immune to blinding attacks
[ ] Different sensor rigs can provide benefits: see through nebulae, etc.
[x] Anarchists should have ROMs and other digital media.
[x] Terrorists should have nuclear detonators (convert to missiles at Tinkers); nuclear
	waste; decon gel.
[ ] Perhaps player can escort fast passenger ships out of Korolov.
[ ] Ruins or other loci of power (like pagan megaliths)
[ ] Ships/stations that use the powers of Oracus/Domina.
[ ] Artifacts: The powers and attributes of these alien artifacts are randomized
	for each game so that the player has to discover them.
[ ] Perhaps the halo gods have not completely disappeared. Perhaps they exists
	as "ghosts" of some sort.
[ ] Banners, etc. representing sovereigns
[ ] Hierodules are like wizards (immortal beings)
[ ] Pirate ships that force player to stop and be boarded.

NEBULAE AND STORMS

[x] Nebula: velocity decay; LRS interference
[ ] Dark Nebula: velocity decay; LRS interference; SRS interference
[ ] Radiation Field: LRS interference; chance of contamination
[ ] Ion Storm: LRS interference; chance of disabling (as per ion cannon)
[ ] Plasma Storm: LRS interference; plasma discharge (plasma damage)

NEW ENCOUNTERS

[ ] An alien ship that steals stuff out of the player's cargo hold (maybe with
	a transporter beam?) and then runs-off to some secret location (perhaps a
	wandering mothership). If the player can find the mothership, he can kill it
	to get back his stuff.
[ ] Perhaps a hacker ship can crack your bank account and steal all your credits
	(or something).
[ ] An alien station that shoots an ion cannon and then drains fuel.
[ ] Enemy ship that controls a swarm of remote-controlled ships. When the main
	ship is destroyed, the robots de-activate (perhaps that player can control them?)
[ ] Salvager-like ship that uses ion cannon to freeze you. Otherwise, it just scavenges.
[ ] Other large ships that do lots of damage if attacked, but otherwise leave you alone.
[ ] Some adventurer ships should also pick-up enhancements (armor coatings, new weapons,
	etc.)
[ ] Some kind of alien ship that splits in two when hit.

PLAYER SHIP

[ ] Main computer system should keep track of running programs (e.g., Autopilot)
[ ] Allow player to remove programs running on main computer system
[ ] Allow player to access programs running on main computer system (for extra features)
[ ] Some kinds of damage should cause LRS blindness
[ ] Defective ROM causes computer to reboot (ship is disabled for period of time)
[ ] Some kinds of damage should cause fuel drain (fuel rod degeneration)
[ ] Damage to engine degrades acceleration
[ ] Damage to engine degrades maximum speed
[ ] Damage to devices
[ ] Damage that causes shields to drain
[ ] Damage that causes armor degeneration
[ ] Contagion: random disease has a chance of killing player (unless specific disease cured)
[ ] Infestation: alien parasite has a chance of killing player
[ ] When the player runs out of fuel, check to see if there are any fuel rods in
	cargo hold. If so, don't end game, just disable ship until the player refuels.
[ ] When SRS is repaired, show message ("Short-range scanner Repaired" or whatever)
[ ] Show armor coatings on armor display (or show in docking-mode).
[ ] Defective ROM (or something) that causes player to spin and fire randomly for a period
	of time.
[ ] Using certain kinds of fuel should increase engine efficiency for a while. But some
	kinds of fuel could screw-up the engines.

ROM IDEAS


SAPIENS

[ ] Need more interesting stuff on Sapiens wrecks (since they are always radioactive).

SHIELD IDEAS

[ ] Stasis Shields: Ship encased in stasis field when hit by weapons
[ ] Stasis suppressors
[ ] Graviton deflectors: immune to gravity
[ ] Shield that only works if ship has light armor
[x] Shield whose strength is proportional to armor
[ ] Shield that is stronger with a particular kind of armor
[x] Shield that must be regenerated manually

SHIP IDEAS

[ ] Thrust from large ships should cause plasma damage.

SISTERS OF DOMINA

[x] Oracle at Sisters of Domina should give the player some hints about the game
	(like fortune cookies in nethack) and some clue as to where to find things. For example,
	the Oracle might tell the player where the next stargate is or where a particularly
	powerful weapon in the system is or may just give the player a map of the whole system.

STATION IDEAS

[ ] Commonwealth Customs: Near stargates. Player must dock with station upon
	first arrival or she will be blacklisted by all commonwealth stations in
	the systems. Docking is just like at station (i.e., illegal items taken).
[ ] Locked stations (or locked sections of a station). Need key or blaster.
[ ] Fortune teller of some sort that makes obscure (and broad) predictions based
	on what really exists in the system.
[ ] Walled city-states that do not let you enter unless you disable weapons and
	lower shields.
[ ] Enemy shipyards that create enemy ships and send them as reinforcements
[ ] Automated defenses that fire on any ship with shields up or any ship exceeding
	speed limit.
[x] Licensed mining colony. Player can purchase raw good (duralloy ore) or sell
	manufactured goods (detonators). Player can be hired to defend mine from pirates.
[ ] Station (maybe Tinkers) that sells custom weapons. Based on normal weapons, but
	some (sometimes significant) improvements.
[ ] Need some place where the player can install illegal/military weapons.

WEAPON IDEAS

[ ] Weapon that turns wrecks into scrap pieces that can be sold.

SISTERS OF DOMINA

Initial conversation:

A

"Welcome, pilgrim! You are far from home, and yet your journey has just begun. Your path to 

the Core will not be easy."

["What makes you think I'm going to the Galactic Core?"] => B
["Can you tell me how to get there?"] => C
["Do you happen to sell any weapons or armor?"] => D

B

"Your eyes are on me, but your mind sees the eternal beauty of Domina. You are called to 

Domina--though you do not know why. Perhaps if you reach her you will understand."

["Tell me about Domina"] => E
["What do you mean, 'if you reach her'?"] => F
["Will she reimburse me for this ship I had to buy?"] => G

C

"The stargates will take you. Seek them out and enter. But be prepared for many obstacles. 

You must grow stronger to reach the Core."

["Why is it so hard to reach the Core?"] => H
["How can I overcome these obstacles?"] => I
["In that case I need weapons. Lots of weapons."] => J

D

"If blood is what you seek, the Universe will provide what you need. It always does. But if 

you find an omnidirectional TeV9, that would be particularly lucky."

["Have you been to the Core?"] => K
["What else will I need on my journey?"] => L
["This better be worth it."] => M
