THE TRANSCENDENCE TRILOGY
-------------------------

Transcendence consists of three adventures:

EarthSpace Quarantine Zone (Level 1 - 10)

The universe of Transcendence is introduced and the adventure begins.
The player must break out of the Quarantine Zone set up by the ancient
alien races to keep the upstart Humans from destabilizing the galaxy.

This adventure consists of 24 star systems.

The Galactics (Level 11 - 20)

The Galaxy is unimaginably vast and filled with incredible wonders.
If only the ancient alien races would leave the player alone. Battling
one faction or another, the player must travel across the galactic disk
searching for the mysterious secret of the Core.

The adventure ends just as the player discovers that the aliens of the
galactic disk are mere youngsters compared to the Old Ones of the Halo.
There are 50 star systems in this adventure.

Oracus & Domina (Level 21 - 25)

Helped by the Halo races and drawn by the enchanting Domina, the player
must journey to the twin black holes at the Galaxy's core and prevent
a cataclysm that could destroy all life in the Galaxy.

STORY ARC
---------

COMMONWEALTH FLEET
------------------

Each of the twelve carriers has a different mission.

All carriers have the following services available to any ship:

Refueling (at high cost)
Armor repair (normal cost)
Weapon/device installation (normal cost)

LEVEL VII

Each level VII system has a 50% chance of having a carrier. When encountered,
there is an equal chance that it will be CSC Sahara, CSC India, or CSC Arctica.
[CSC Atlantica is always encountered in the Zheling system]. The same carrier
cannot be encountered in two different systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSC Sahara					Sahara is a hospital ship, treating wounded from the
							front. The player may sell medical supplies to the
							ship for a good profit. Or she may give the supplies
							away. If she gives enough supplies, the captain will
							reward the player with some good shields.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSC India

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSC Arctica					(same as CSC Sahara)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSC Atlantica				The Zheling system is an active warzone. If the
							player wants to join in the war, she will participate
							in an attack on a massive formation of Ares ships.
							If the attack is successful, the player is rewarded
							with a commendation and payment of some kind.

TREASURE TYPES
--------------

CONSUMABLES

ammo (including missiles)
consumable (fuel/ammo/armor patches/etc.)
fuel
treasure (otherwise useless to player)

MINOR ITEMS

armor
enhancements (armor coatings/permanent roms)

MAJOR ITEMS

device (misc device/shield/weapon)
misc device
shield
weapon

The average ratio of treasure for stations of a given level should be:

40% consumables
40% minor items
20% major items

When balancing out the treasure for a station, allocate 100 points worth
using the following costs (where n is the level of the station):

1 major item of level n+1				400
1 major item of level n					200
1 minor item of level n+1				200
1 major item of level n-1				100
1 minor item of level n					100
1 consumable of level n+1				100
1 minor item of level n-1				50
1 consumable of level n					50
1 consumable of level n-1				25

Costs are adjusted proportionally if the treasure only has a chance of appearing.
For example, a 50% chance to find a major item of level n is 50% of 200 (or 100).

EARTHSPACE QUARANTINE ZONE STORY ARC
------------------------------------

CHOSEN

A dream convinces the player that he must journey to the Galactic Core.
There he will receive a glimpse of the Eternal Pattern of the Cosmos
in exchange for a small favor. But first he has to get there... [Opening
screen.]

EARTHSPACE QUARANTINE ZONE

Getting around the Galaxy is easy. The network of stargates built by
the Galactics leads to the Core. Unfortunately, the alien races have
blockaded the stargates leading out of EarthSpace to prevent the
Galaxy from being overrun by the violent and unpredictable humans.

INVOKING THE POWERS OF DOMINA

The powers of Domina may be invoked as long as:

1. Relationship with Oracus is 0 or less
2. Powers were invoked more than the invocation timeout.

	SUSTAIN (cost: 0)

	If the player is under attack, he is protected by an impenetrable
	shield for some amount of time.

	Otherwise, if the player is out of fuel, the ship is refueled.

	HEAL (cost: 20)

	All armor is repaired fully (no matter its condition) and shields
	are instantly regenerated.

	STRENGTHEN (cost: 40)

	Player's weapons do triple damage for some amount of time.

	DEFEND (cost: 80)

	Minor hierodule appears and fights for the player.

	AVENGE (cost: 200)

	Major hierodule appears and fights for the player.

	RESURRECT (cost: 1000)

	If the player's ship is destroyed and he has 1000 or greater
	relationship with Domina (and no relationship with Oracus), then he
	is resurrected with an intact ship in some other area of the system.

If the powers of Domina are invoked before the invocation timeout,
or if the player invokes powers with a negative relationship,
then the following things will happen to the player:

Relationship < 0:	"I cannot help those who cannot help themselves"
					-100 relationship

Relationship = 0:	"Allowing you to struggle is the best help I can offer"
					-25 relationship

Relationship > 0:	"Do not rely on my powers, child"
					-20 relationship

If the player's relationship with Domina is negative, then he gains
one point every 100 ticks.

	CONTAMINATE (cost: 40)

	Enemy ships in the area are contaminated with radiation.

	SUMMON (cost: 80)

	Major hierodule appears and fights for the player. If the player's
	armor is not damaged, the hierodule attacks the player (because
	he should only call in emergencies).

	ANNIHILATE (cost: 200)

	All enemy ships in area are hit with 5d12 point of dark acid damage.
	Player's shields are depleted.
