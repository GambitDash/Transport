	to be marauders (player should destroy them).
[ ] Mission: Player must escort a rescue ship to a disabled passenger ship that is
	under attack by Sung Slavers. Player must fight slavers while rescue ship docks
	with passenger ship. Then, player must escort rescue ship back to fortress.

ITEMS, MISCELLANEOUS

[ ] Active scanner array: Sees through nebula; when used, can "scan" near-by objects,

	in LRS range; but we clip to a circle, so we should only show the message if
	ships enter the circular area.
[ ] Add an option to repair all armor.
[ ] Insurance ship should not get stuck in arena (it should be able to navigate somehow).
[ ] Momentum damage should be able to accelerate ships beyond their max
