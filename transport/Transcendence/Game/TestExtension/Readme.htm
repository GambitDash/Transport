<h1>Welcome to Transcendence!</h1>

<p>Transcendence has been designed to be easily extended and modified by interested
players. At this time, the documentation and infrastructure for these modifications
are very limited. Nevertheless, we encourage you to look at the source game definitions
and experiment at will.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence/forums/">Transcendence Forums</a> are a great place to ask questions about
game modifications.</p>

<p>For more information on the game and to download the latest version, visit
the <A href="http://www.neurohack.com/transcendence">Transcendence</A> page online.</p>

<h2>Caveats, Warnings, and Disclaimers</h2>
