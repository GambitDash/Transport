		<h2>About this Version</h2>
		Transcendence version 0.99 is a beta&nbsp;release.&nbsp;Some of the game is 
		still not finished and in particular you may find that it is not that much fun. 
		The framework, however, is more or less in place and I believe that once the 
		universe is fleshed-out more that Transcendence will be a lot of fun.<BR>
